# Hello-World
This Github account is for Chris H. Wilson, a scientist and researcher at the University of Florida.  
My goal is to help ranchers and farmers manage their land better through an integration of science,
and holistic adaptive management and co-management. Currently, I am exploring the mechanisms underpinning
SOC cycling in pastures and rangelands using experiments and mathematical models. The long-term goal is
to parameterize two competing model frameworks - microbially explicit versus implicit - with data from 
in situ isotopic tracer studies using Bayesian data assimilation.
